This directory contains data files used by more than one example.

For all examples to work you must edit the file [TokenRequest.json](/examples/data/TokenRequest.json) so it has valid api credentials.  If you do not then the examples that access our server api will fail.

The file [public.pem](/examples/data/public.pem) contains the public certs needed to access the grpc api on both our dev and production servers.
